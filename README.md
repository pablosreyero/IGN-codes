# IGN codes (internship)

In this repository, you can find the final report, as well as all the codes developed during my two-month internship at the Spanish Geographic Institute in Madrid. Due to the work developed, I graduated with honours in this 6 ECTS course.

The beginning of my internship consisted mainly of understanding seismic events, as well as the attributes that characterise them, including; surface wave transmissions, coordinates, physical properties of the scenarios, and of course, the dynamics of seismic sensors.
These initial steps were crucial to develop a code capable of extracting attributes and knowledge from a specific seismic record, so that in the future, this knowledge can be fed into a machine learning API to distinguish between real seismic events or man-made explosions, either on land or at sea (this applies to both man-made and natural events).
